            Agriculture is a predominant sector in Bangladesh in generating
            livelihood, employment, and GDP contribution. Although agriculture
            remains the third most contributing sector to the countryâ€™s GDP, its
            contribution has decreased over the past decade going from 17% In
            2010 to 12.6% in 2020. The industry is also a significant
            contributor to export earnings and provider of raw material sources
            for other sectors, such as poultry and livestock feed, leather,
            frozen food, canned food, etc. It is the core of the Bangladeshi
            economy, playing an essential role in reducing poverty and achieving
            food security in the past.
